# GeoThermoExplorers-Satellite-Based-Pollution-and-Greenery-Analysis-with-Future-Forecast
"GeoThermoExplorers" is a cutting-edge initiative focused on Satellite-Based Pollution and Greenery Analysis with Future Forecast. This innovative project harnesses the power of satellite technology to monitor and analyze environmental factors, specifically targeting pollution levels and greenery across various regions.

This project makes use of Google Earth Engine, a cutting-edge technological tool, and Google Collab for the code implementation. Our team, GeoThermoExplorers, produced this repository specifically for Google's Solution Challenge 2024.


The GeoThermoExplorers project started because we wanted to tackle big problems like pollution and the decreasing green areas worldwide. We know these issues seriously affect people's health, nature, and the planet's overall well-being. So, our team decided to use advanced satellite technology to closely watch and understand environmental issues. Our project focuses on studying pollution and greenery with the help of satellites and predicting what might happen in the future. We want to share important information to help discussions about making the world more sustainable and protecting the environment. We feel an urgent need to learn, predict, and find ways to deal with pollution and the loss of green spaces. That's why we built a smart system that not only keeps an eye on what's happening now but also tells us what might happen later. Our main goal is to give valuable information to governments, organizations, and communities so they can make smart decisions and work together for a healthier and more sustainable future.

Visualization of various Factors That affect Pollution

# 1.AQI_BUCKET_VIzwalization.png:
This graph visualizes the Air Quality Index (AQI) distribution across different pollution levels. The color-coded buckets provide a clear representation of air quality, aiding in the identification of pollution severity at a glance.

The pollution levels are ranging from bars of poor to Good depicted with different colors
